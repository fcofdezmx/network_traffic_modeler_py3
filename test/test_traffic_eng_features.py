# Test cases
# - LSPs won't transit over non-rsvp_enabled interface on both models
# - percent_reserved_bandwidth limits amount of reservable_bandwidth on Interface
#       - test return self._reservable_bandwidth on Interface
# - try manually setting reservable_bandwidth on an interface

# TODO - make model file that has 3 identical circuit_id values - should error out
# TODO - test parallel links but one w higher metric
